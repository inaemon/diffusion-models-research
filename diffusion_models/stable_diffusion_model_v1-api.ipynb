text-to-image latent diffusion model created by the researchers and engineers from CompVis, Stability AI and LAION. Latent diffusion applies the diffusion process over a lower dimensional latent space to reduce memory and compute complexity. This specific type of diffusion model was proposed in High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models by Robin Rombach, Andreas Blattmann, Dominik Lorenz, Patrick Esser, Bj√∂rn Ommer.\n","\n","   - Stable Diffusion is trained on 512x512 images from a subset of the LAION-5B dataset. This model uses a frozen CLIP ViT-L/14 text encoder to condition the model on text prompts. With its 860M UNet and 123M text encoder, the model is relatively lightweight and can run on consumer GPUs.\n","\n","   - For more details about how Stable Diffusion works and how it differs from the base latent diffusion model, take a look at the Stability AI announcement and our own blog post for more technical details.\n","\n","   - You can find the original codebase for Stable Diffusion v1.0 at CompVis/stable-diffusion and Stable Diffusion v2.0 at Stability-AI/stablediffusion as well as their original scripts for various tasks. Additional official checkpoints for the different Stable Diffusion versions and tasks can be found on the CompVis, Runway, and Stability AI Hub organizations. Explore these organizations to find the best checkpoint for your use-case!\n","\n","   - The table below summarizes the available Stable Diffusion pipelines, their supported tasks, and an interactive
